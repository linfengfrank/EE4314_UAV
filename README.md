## ðŸš€ Quick Run Guidance: Circular Trajectory Demo

This demo generates a **constant-speed circular trajectory** in the NED frame and runs it through the provided Simulink position control model.  

### 1. Setup
- Download and extract the entire repository.  
- Open **MATLAB**

### 2. Run the Script
- Open **`circle_traj_demo.m`** in MATLAB.  
- Click **Run** (or press `F5`).
